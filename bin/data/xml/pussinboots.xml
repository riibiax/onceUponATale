		<p n="1" img="1">Once upon a time there was a miller, who was so poor that at his death he had nothing to leave to his three children but his mill, his donkey, and his cat. The eldest son took the mill, and the second the ass, so there was nothing left for poor  but to take <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character>.</p>
		<p n="2" img="2">Jack could not help thinking that <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> had been treated shabbily. "My brothers will be able to earn an honest livelihood," <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> sighed, "but as for me, though <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> may feed <character n="1" type="reflexive">himself</character> by catching mice, I shall certainly die of hunger." The <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character>, who had overheard <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> young master, jumped upon <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> shoulder, and, rubbing <character n="1" type="reflexive">himself</character> gently against <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> cheek, began to speak.</p> 
		<p n="3" img="2">"Dear master," said <character n="1" type="subject">he</character>, "do not grieve. I am not as useless as you think-me, and will undertake to make your fortune for you, if only you will buy me a pair of boots, and give me that old bag."</p>
		<p n="4" img="2">Now, Jack had very little money to spare, but, knowing <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> to be a faithful old friend, <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> made up <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> mind to trust <character n="1" type="object">him</character>, and so spent all <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> possessed upon a smart pair of boots made of buff-colored leather. They fitted perfectly, so <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> put them on, took the old bag which <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> master gave <character n="1" type="object">him</character>, and trotted off to a neighboring warren in which <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> knew there was a great number of rabbits.</p>
		<p n="5" img="3">Having put some bran and fresh parsley into the bag, he laid it upon the ground, hid <character n="1" type="reflexive">himself</character>, and waited. Presently two foolish little rabbits, sniffing the food, ran straight into the bag,' when the clever <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character> drew the strings and caught them.</p>
		<p n="6" img="3">Then, slinging the bag over <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> shoulder, <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> hastened off to the palace, where <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> asked to speak to the King. Having been shown into the royal presence, <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> bowed and said:</p>
		<p n="7" img="3">"Sire, my Lord the Marquis of Carabas has commanded me to present these rabbits to your Majesty, with <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> respects."</p>
		<p n="8" img="3">The monarch having desired his thanks to be given to the Marquis (who, as you will guess, was really our poor Jack), then ordered his head cook to dress the rabbits for dinner, and he and his daughter partook of them with great enjoyment.</p>
		<p n="9" img="3">Day by day <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> brought home stores of good food, so that <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> and <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> master lived in plenty, and besides that, <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> did not fail to keep the King and his courtiers well supplied with game.</p>
		<p n="10" img="3">Sometimes <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> would lay a brace of partridges at the royal feet, sometimes a fine large hare, but whatever it was, it always came with the same message: "From my Lord the Marquis of Carabas"; so that everyone at Court was talking of this strange nobleman, whom no one had ever seen, but who sent such generous presents to <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> Majesty.</p>
		<p n="11" img="4">At length <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> decided that it was time for <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> master to be introduced at Court. So one day <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> persuaded <character n="2" type="object">him</character> to go and bathe in a river near, having heard that the King would soon pass that way. Jack stood shivering up to <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> neck in water, wondering what was to happen next, when suddenly the King's carriage appeared in sight. At once <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> began to call out as loudly as <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> could:</p>
		<p n="12" img="4">"Help, help! My Lord the Marquis of Carabas is drowning!"</p>
		<p n="13" img="4">The King put his head out of the carriage window and, recognizing the <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character>, ordered his attendants to go to the assistance of the Marquis. While Jack was being taken out of the water, <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> ran to the King and told him that some robbers had run off with <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> master's clothes whilst <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> was bathing, the truth of the matter being that the cunning <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character> had hidden them under a stone.</p>
		<p n="14" img="4">On hearing this story the King instantly despatched one of his grooms to fetch a handsome suit of purple and gold from the royal wardrobe, and arrayed in this, Jack, who was a fine, handsome fellow, looked so well that no one for a moment supposed but that <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> was some noble foreign lord.</p>
		<p n="15" img="4">The King and his daughter were so pleased with <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> appearance that they invited <character n="2" type="object">him</character> into their carriage.</p>
		<p n="16" img="5">At first Jack hesitated, for <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> felt a little shy about sitting next to a Princess, but she smiled at <character n="2" type="object">him</character> so sweetly, and was so kind and gentle, that <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> soon forgot <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> fears and fell in love with her there and then.</p>
		<p n="17" img="5">As soon as <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> had seen <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> master seated in the royal carriage, he whispered directions to the coachman, and then ran on ahead as fast as he could trot, until he came to a field of corn, where the reapers were busy.</p>
		<p n="18" img="5">"Reapers," said he fiercely, "the King will shortly pass this way. If he should ask you to whom this field belongs, remember that you say, 'To the Marquis of Carabas.' If you dare to disobey me, I will have you all chopped up as fine as mincemeat." The reapers were so afraid the <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character> would keep <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> word that they promised to obey.</p>
		<p n="19" img="5"><character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> then ran on and told all the other laborers whom <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> met to give the same answer, threatening them with terrible punishments if they disobeyed. Now, the King was in a very good humor, for the day was fine, and he found the Marquis a very pleasant companion, so he told the coachman to drive slowly, in order that he might admire the beautiful country.</p>
		<p n="20" img="5">"What a fine field of wheat!" he said presently. "To whom does it belong?" Then the men answered as they had been told: "To our Lord the Marquis of Carabas." Next they met a herd of cattle, and again to the King's question, "To whom do they belong?" they Were told, "To the Marquis of Carabas." And it was the same with everything they passed.</p>
		<p n="21" img="5">The Marquis listened with the greatest astonishment, and thought what a very wonderful <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character> <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> dear <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> was; and the King was delighted to find that his new friend was as wealthy as he was charming.</p>
		<p n="22" img="6">Meanwhile <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character>, who was well in advance of the Royal party, had arrived at a stately castle, which belonged to a cruel Ogre, the richest ever known, for all the lands the King had admired so much belonged to him. <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> knocked at the door and asked to see the Ogre, who received <character n="1" type="object">him</character> quite civilly, for he had never seen a <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character> in boots before, and the sight amused him.</p>
		<p n="23" img="6">So he and <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> were soon chatting away together.</p>
		<p n="24" img="6">The Ogre, who was very conceited, began to boast of what clever tricks he could play, and <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> sat and listened, with a smile on <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> face. "I once heard, great Ogre," <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> said at last, "that you possessed the power of changing yourself into any kind of animal you chose--a lion or an elephant, for instance."</p>
		<p n="25" img="6">"Well, so I can," replied the Ogre.</p>
		<p n="26" img="6">"Dear me! how much I should like to see you do it now," said <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> sweetly.</p>
		<p n="27" img="6">The Ogre was only too pleased to find a chance of showing how very clever he was, so he promised to transform himself into any animal <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> might mention.</p>
		<p n="28" img="6">There <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> sat, refusing to come down, until the Ogre changed himself into his natural form, and laughingly called to <character n="2" type="object">him</character> that he would not hurt <character n="1" type="object">him</character>. Then <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> ventured back into the room, and began to compliment the Ogre on his cleverness.</p>
		<p n="29" img="7">"Of course, it was all very wonderful," <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> said, "but it would be more wonderful still if you, who are so great and fierce, could transform yourself into some timid little creature, such as a mouse. That, I suppose, would be quite impossible ?"</p>
		<p n="30" img="7">"Not at all," said the vain Ogre; "one is quite as easy to me as the other, as I will show you." And in a moment a little brown mouse was frisking about all over the floor, whilst the Ogre had vanished.</p>
		<p n="31" img="7">"Now or never," said <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character>, and with a spring <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> seized the mouse and gobbled it up as fast as <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> could.</p>
		<p n="32" img="7">At the same moment all the gentlemen and ladies whom the wicked Ogre had held in his castle under a spell, became disenchanted. They were so grateful to their deliverer that they would have done anything to please <character n="1" type="object">him</character>, and readily agreed to enter into the service of the Marquis of Carabas when <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> asked them to do so.</p>
		<p n="33" img="8">So now the <character n="1" type="synonyme1">cat</character> had a splendid castle, which <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> knew to be full of heaped-up treasures, at <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> command, and ordering a magnificent feast to be prepared, <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> took up <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> station at the castle gates to welcome <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> master and the royal party. As soon as the castle appeared in sight, the King enquired whose it was, "For," said he, "I have never seen a finer."</p>
		<p n="34" img="8">Then <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character>, bowing low, threw open the castle gates, and cried:</p>
		<p n="35" img="8">"May it please your Majesty to alight and enter the home of the most noble the Marquis of Carabas."</p>
		<p n="36" img="9">Full of surprise, the King turned to the Marquis. "Is this splendid castle indeed yours?" he asked. "Not even our own palace is more beautiful, and doubtless it is as splendid within as without."</p>
		<p n="37" img="9"><character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> then helped <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> Majesty to alight, and conducted <character n="2" type="object">him</character> into the castle, where a group of noble gentlemen and fair ladies were waiting to receive them. Jack, or the Marquis as <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> was now called, gave <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> hand to the young Princess, and led her to the banquet.</p>
		<p n="38" img="9">Long and merrily they feasted, and when at length the guests rose to depart, the King embraced the Marquis, and called <character n="2" type="object">him</character> his dear son; and the Princess blushed so charmingly and looked so shy and sweet, that Jack ventured to lay <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> heart and fortune at her feet.</p>
		<p n="39" img="9">And so the miller's son married the King's daughter, and there were great rejoicings throughout the land.</p>
		<p n="40" img="9">On the evening of the wedding-day a great ball was given, to which princes and noblemen from far and near were invited. <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> opened the ball, wearing for the occasion a pair of boots made of the finest leather, with gold tassels and scarlet heels. I only wish you could have seen <character n="1" type="object">him</character>.</p>
		<p n="41" img="9">When the old King died, the Princess and her husband reigned in his stead, and their most honored and faithful friend at Court was <character n="1" type="name">Puss</character> <character n="1" type="reflexive">himself</character>, for <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> master never forgot to whom <character n="2" type="subject">he</character> owed all <character n="2" type="possessive">his</character> good fortune: <character n="1" type="subject">he</character> lived upon the daintiest meat and most delicious cream, and was petted and made much of all the days of <character n="1" type="possessive">his</character> life, and never again ran after mice and rats, except for exercise and amusement.</p>
