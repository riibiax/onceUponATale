Once Upon a Tale is a tactile book and interactive storytelling.

Based on the best-known children's stories, the application gives us the opportunity to reinvent, to create our own stories.

With the card game that comes with it, or simply by the touch interface, choose the characters and settings of your story among all those offered tales. And you generate a number of stories and illustrations infinity. The stories will mix. You can always change characters or settings to your preference.
